We wrote a script to create a tree representation of these reply chains.\nFrom the reply chain we counted the number of paths from root of the tree to the end of each branch (the width) and the number of tweets from the root to the end of the longest branch (the depth).

Their precise origin position (which correspond to the left corner on the top in each square) results from a Classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), a mathematical means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset. Starting from a distance matrix originated from conversations and topics. Conversations are then positioned in the space according to their combination of topics."

The Text-davinci-003 model was used to perform the task. It did not receive any human labelled data or fine-tuning. The following text was used to prompt an answer:\nzero_shot_prompt = '''You are a data expert working for a top research University. You are   analysing twitter biography strings (also known as 'bios') in order to determine the profession and/or field of each individual and classify them into one of several categories. The different categories are: humanities, scientist, engineer, media, activism, professions, industry, research, tech industry, and hybrid. You should use hybrid when the individual is best described as a combination of the categories listed above. Make sure you write out all categories in lowercase and do not make any spelling errors! Also make sure you only choose the single best category that represents the individual. Do not include any punctuation in your classification label, such as periods or quotation marks. If you can't tell what it is, write: 'Could not classify'.\nExample: Twitter Bio: TWITTER_BIO\nThe classification is:'''\nThe output was then post-processed in R to:\n\nremove dots and commas at the of the string;\nrecategorise ‚Äúcreative‚Äù categories generated by the model. For example, multiple categories, such as ‚ÄúScientist, Research, Tech‚Äù were recategorised to ‚ÄúHybrid‚Äù to fit categories listed in the prompt;"
